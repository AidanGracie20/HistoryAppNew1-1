We were recently given a programming assignment, the point of the assignment was to create a Kotlin program, My close friend Sarah heard I was quite good at making applications, so she has asked me to create an app that when someone enters any random age between 20 and 100, the program will process this number and give an output resulting in a famous person who had passed away at that specific age the user entered. It is very important that we know the age that these famous people passed away, as some of these people have paved the way in their fields, such as Martin Luther King (39) who was one of the most influential activists of all time and Kobe Bryant (41) who was one of the greatest basketball players to ever live, who single handedly made it everyone’s dream to play in the NBA (https://www.famousbirthdays.com/)

As I have previously stated Sarah asked me to create the app, the actual purpose of this app is to help her students learn more about history and some historical figures that lived before them. Sarahs dream is to educate her pupils so that they can also grow into avid history buffs such as Sarah herself. The programming language we are learning in our introduction to mobile application development module is called Kotlin, Kotlin is used to develop mobile applications specifically on Androids. So through the help of our past programming, my lecturer and some class mates I successfully created a fully working application that fulfils all the expectations that the application should. 

Kotlin is a powerful, concise, and expressive language that is crafted by JetBrains. One of Kotlin’s main functions is its ability to handle large datasets very well and quickly. Kotlin is also very helpful when designing you application, with many different features that can be used, such as TextViews, EditTexts and Buttons that you can colour and design and then program to do what you want. For example in my program when you enter an age between 20 and 100 in the First EditText, and then click on the button saying “Generate History”, the app will process this information and tell you a famous person that passed away at that specific age you entered, the age will be showed in the TextView box at the bottom of the application. We were also tasked to create and add “Clear” button to our program which would clear the age you inputted into the EditText so that you can enter another age. At the centre of Kotlin is used to streamline data processing tasks, catering to the needs of various industries where data management is pivotal. The program harnesses Kotlin's object-oriented and functional programming capabilities to deliver a seamless user experience while ensuring optimal performance.

Another task we were given in our application was to put in some additional error handling coding, and my program does exact that, so when you enter an input into the EditText that is not a number between 20 and 100, a error message will be shown. The error message says, “Invalid information, Please enter age between 20 and 100.”. Kotlin is an impressive programming language that has a robust system, that helps the user to identify errors and fix them, giving many suggestions on what do to about the error. As Kotlin has a comprehensive error detection system that informs the user of their particular error straight away and give suggestions on how to fix it. The app I created uses all of Kotlin’s features, showcasing all the error handling software and the very expressive syntax.

The way the app was created was through a lot of trial and error on my part. When creating my Kotlin program that’s point is to inform students when famous individuals passed away such as Michael Jackson, Wilt Chamberlain, Nelson Mandela, Henry Ford and footballing icons such as Pele and Diego Maradona. The app works by the user entering an age between 20 and 100 and then clicking the “Generate History” button that will tell the program to find who passed away at that age from all the information that I put into the code. For example if the user inputs 60 into the EditText then Diego Maradona will display in the TextView box at the bottom of the program.

Now I will be taking you through how I created the app from scratch. Firstly I created the User Interface of the app where I downloaded the “History” graphic that I used, and this graphic is present at the top of my application, then afterwards I coloured the entire page the same colour as the ‘History” graphic, which was a bluey turquoise. I then added two TextViews, two Buttons and one EditText. The first TextView is used as information, it reads, “Enter an age between 20-100 below  and click “Generate history” to find out which famous person passed away at that age”. Then the EditText is below that where you can enter the age that you want, and the app will tell you a famous person that passed away at that age. Then below that are the two Buttons, these two buttons are the “Clear” and “Generate History” buttons. The purpose of the “Clear” button is to erase the age that the user inputted, so that it is clear, and another age can be inputted straight afterwards. The purpose of the  “Generate History” button is that when the user enters any age between 20 and 100 and then clicks the ‘Generate History” the program will process this information and give the output matching the age. The final item I added was a TextView at the bottom of the application, this is where the famous person who passed away name will be displayed with some extra information.

Now taking you through the actual coding of the project, firstly I declared everything such as the TextViews, EditTexts and Buttons (the picture below shows the declarations. 
 

Next, I created the coding for the clear button, this clears the number entered into the EditText box (as shown below in the picture) 
 

After that I coded for the “Generate History” button, so firstly that the button is clickable and secondly that the button does what it is intended to do (the coding used is shown below).
 

After that I used a IF statement so that if the user entered “20” then the right information was displayed (the coding I used for the IF statement is below).
 

After that I used an IF ELSE statement, this basically says if the number is not “20” it will be what you have entered in the IF ELSE statement. I then entered that statement around another eighty times each with a different age ranging between 21 and 100. (the picture below shows what I mean).
